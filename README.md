# Natural Language Semantic Code Search


![Alt Text](./gifs/Natural_Language_Code_Search_Demo.gif)

**Features:**

 - Searches code not comments. So you can find code that you are looking for!  We can add ability to search comments trivially.  
 - Can find code even if you don't know the syntax
 - Can find code even if you don't know what keywords to search for
 - Search is not sensitive to synonyms or specific word choice. Instead searches for "meaning"

**Product**
 - Product idea will be to augment our existing search (not replace it) by also returning results of semantic code search in addition to classic search.   

**Resources:**
