# Natural Language Semantic Code Search


![Alt Text](./gifs/Natural_Language_Code_Search_Demo.gif)

**Features:**

 - Searches code, not comments. So you can find code that you are looking for!
 - Can find code even if you don't know the syntax
 - Can find code even if you don't know what keywords to search for
 - Search is not sensitive to synonyms or specific word choice. Instead searches for "meaning"


**Resources:**

- Technique that inspired this approach: (DeVisE)[ http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5204-devise-a-deep-visual-semantic-embedding-model.pdf]
- The open source version of this will be hosted [here](https://github.com/hamelsmu/code_search)
- Medium blog post: TBD
